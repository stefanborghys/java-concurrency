/**
 * Computer users take it for granted that their systems can do more than one thing at a time.</br>
 * They assume that they can continue to work in a word processor, while other applications download files,</br>
 * manage the print queue, and stream audio.</br>
 * Even a single application is often expected to do more than one thing at a time.</br>
 * For example, that streaming audio application must simultaneously read the digital audio off the network,</br>
 * decompress it, manage playback, and update its display.</br>
 * Even the word processor should always be ready to respond to keyboard and mouse events,</br>
 * no matter how busy it is reformatting text or updating the display.</br>
 * Software that can do such things is known as <i>concurrent</i> software.</br>
 * </br>
 * The Java platform is designed from the ground up to support concurrent programming,</br>
 * with basic concurrency support in the Java programming language and the Java class libraries.</br>
 * Since version 5.0, the Java platform has also included high-level concurrency APIs.</br>
 * This lesson introduces the platform's basic concurrency support and summarizes some of the high-level APIs in the java.util.concurrent packages.
